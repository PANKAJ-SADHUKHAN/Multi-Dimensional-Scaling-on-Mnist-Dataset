# Multi-Dimensional-Scaling-on-MNIST-data
Multi-Dimensional-Scaling(MDS) from scratch

In this project, we implement the Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm from scratch to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.

## Overview

Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) is a technique used for visualizing the similarity or dissimilarity of data points in a lower-dimensional space. It aims to preserve the pairwise distances or dissimilarities between data points as much as possible.

## Dataset

We utilized MNIST dataset for MDS analysis. The dataset is included in this repository but you can use your own dataset as well.

## Implementation

Our implementation of the Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm is provided in the Jupyter Notebook `mds.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code for computing pairwise distances or dissimilarities, performing MDS, and visualizing the lower-dimensional representation of the data.

## Repository Structure
